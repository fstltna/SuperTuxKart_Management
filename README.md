Edit "stkmc" and change the settings at the top if your Super Tux Kart server is not in /home/stkowner/install.

You also need to have my Super Tux Kart Server Startup Script installed.

I suggest you then add this to your /home/stkowner/.bashrc file:
	export PATH=/home/stkowner/SuperTuxKart_Management:/home/stkowner/bin:$PATH

After that you should log out and back in and now "stkmc" should work.
